Revit tools inspired by pyRevit, but in c#.


# Current Tools

  - Allows users to swap viewports (some hidden) to another type to enable purging of those unwanted types
- Who created this view?
  - Using [worksharing display](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/blob/fe576807203292ce9a05b3cfeb508b0f9ff0ddbd/src/Rhythm/Rhythm.SharedProject/Revit/Worksharing/Element.cs#L20-L57), find out who created the view.
- Who created selected element?
  - prompt for selection and do the same as for views above
